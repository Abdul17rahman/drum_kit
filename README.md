# Drum Kit JavaScript

This is like a band play where u can play different sounds of a drum and its part of the javaScript web development course exercise by Dr Angella Yu. Its a fun for music lovers done with html, small css and javaScript.
Not 100% complete but enjoy, i will improve it when i get time and as well update the readme.
